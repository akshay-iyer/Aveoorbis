Personalising the world around you!

A project that allowed guests to personalize the world around them

Guests enter their temperature preferences and choice of entertainment and are given RFID chips to be worn around the wrist. The settings change as they move around the house 

In shopping malls, the user needs to share his shopping list and the corresponding shelves with those items pop out for him when he goes to that section in the store
